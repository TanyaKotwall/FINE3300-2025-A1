This repository is for Assignment 1 which contains code in Python using Visual Studio Code for Canadian Home Mortgage Payments class and Bank of Canada Currency Exchange Rates class.   

## Contents
1. `MortgagePayments.py` This project implements a **MortgagePayment** class that calculates mortgage payments for Canadian home loans under different payment frequencies. It converts a quoted annual interest rate (with semi-annual compounding) into an effective annual rate, then computes payments using the **Present Value of an Annuity (PVA)** formula.

The program prompts the user for: Principal amount ($), Interest rate (%), Amortization period (years)

It returns the corresponding mortgage payments for different frequencies: Monthly, Semi-Monthly, Bi-Weekly, Weekly, Rapid Bi-Weekly, Rapid Weekly  

This tool can be reused across various home mortgages requiring standardized mortgage payment calculations.
2. `ExchangeRates.py` → Reads Bank of Canada exchange rate CSV and converts between USD and CAD.
3. `README.md` → This file describes the project.
